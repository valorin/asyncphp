Asynchronous PHP
================

*Control and manipulate client-side Javascript from server-side PHP.*

Similar concept to [xajax](https://github.com/Xajax/Xajax), **Asynchronous PHP**
is designed to allow developers to utalize the full power of a Javascript
framework like jQuery within their PHP code. Saving time and effort by removing
the need to keep both JS source and PHP source in-sync.

*Asynchronous PHP is still very much in early development.*
